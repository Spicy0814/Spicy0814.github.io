I live in an averge town called Lerum and lived here my hole life. On my free time I like to play videogames, watch youtube and talk to friends over the phone.</p>
                
                <p>I'm pretty new to coding HTML and CSS but I'm learning pretty quickly. Now I even love making websites, sure it takes some time and some searching around on the internet but surely I'm getting there.</p>
                
                <p>I've also started with computer and network science where we're currently working with a Raspberry Pi and we're almost done setting it up. My group are going to make a vpn server from our Raspberry Pi while the other groups are making a local Wi-Fi and server's.</p>
