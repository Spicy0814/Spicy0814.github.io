                <p>Hello! My name is Samuel and I'm not one of the regual people you will meet in you life time. Let me tell you my story. I was born 14 of august in 2003. I live in an averge town called Lerum and lived here my hole life. On my free time I like to play videogames, watch youtube and talk to friends over the phone.</p>
                
                <p>I'm pretty new to coding HTML and CSS but I'm learning pretty quickly. Now I even love making websites, sure it takes some time and some searching around on the internet but surely I'm getting there.</p>
                
                <p>I've also started with computer and network science where we're currently working with a Raspberry Pi and we're almost done setting it up. My group are going to make a vpn server from our Raspberry Pi while the other groups are making a local Wi-Fi and server's.</p>

                <h3>Experience and Learning</h3>
                
                <p><strong>HTML & CSS</strong> - I've been working with html and css for over two months so I got the basics down. I'm learning quickly and making fast progress.</p>
                
                <p><strong>SDR</strong> - I've worked for Svensk Direktreklam for almost 1 year and 2 months. Every weekend I go around my district and leave advertisment in peoples' mailboxes.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Ica</strong> - I've been put into practice at Ica about three times and my dad is the store manager of one of Ica's stores. So I know the basics and a little more when it comes to grocery stores.</p>
